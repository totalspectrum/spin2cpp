  improvements

Version 3.9.1
- Fixed some bugs in common subexpression elimination
- Fixed conditional instructions in inline assembly
- Improved loop strength reduction optimizations
- Added missing popa instruction for P2, also missing rd/wr address mode
- Added +/ and +// unsigned division operators to Spin

  until 4.0.0).
  
Version 3.8.7
- Improved constant propagation for REP instructions
- Fixed addresses for listing in P1 mode
- Fixed an optimization problem where hw registers could be used
  to hold intermediate values in a calculation

- Fixed a bug where aliases like neg a -> neg a,a could generate
  incorrect code
- Fixed CSE where hardware registers are set so that they do not
  invalidate all entries
- Made some improvements to listing files

Version 3.8.5
- Improve inline assembly: allow labels
- Fix string constants in case labels (they should be treated as
  lists)
- Big revision of how listing files are created. This is worse for all
  assembly files (DAT section output is a bit weaker) but much better
  for regular Spin files, which can now have listing files.
- Fixed coginit of Spin methods in P2
- Add a check for recursive symbol definition

Version 3.8.4
- Automatically promote literal strings to string("foo") if they are
  being passed to a function that expects a pointer

- Provide some inline assembly support for C/C++

Version 3.8.3
- Allow multiple return values to in turn be passed to functions as
  parameters
- Allow default values for parameters. So far these must be constant
- added Spin2 <=>, \, and XOR operators

  doing so

Version 3.8.1
- Added -l flag to fastspin to produce a listing file
- Fixed multiple returns from functions with no parameters
- Added pusha, pushb, modc, modz aliases for P2 instructions
- Various fixes for P2 binary output

Version 3.8.0
- Added multiple assignments like (x,y) := (y,x)
- Added ability for functions to return multiple values
- Made the preprocessor work correctly with Mac encoded files (CR for
  end of line)
- Made fastspin -w work correctly in P2 mode
- if fastspin is named something ending with "spin2" (like
  "fastspin2") then it will start in Propeller2 mode by default
- if no Spin methods are present, do not emit any of the Spin
  initialization code, just output the DAT section 
- simplified parsing of \ expressions

Version 3.7.2
- Updated P2 support to v32
- Fixed some bugs in common subexpression elimination
- Made the --nocse flag to spin2cpp actually work
- Fixed labels at end of input
- Fixed @result in assembly output

Version 3.7.1
- Fixed a nasty bug in assignment operators ("a[i++] += b" was being
  treated as "a[i++] = a[i++] + b", which is obviously wrong)

Version 3.7.0
- Added the -w flag to fastspin to allow creation of assembly language
  wrappers for Spin methods. See docs/SpinPasmIntegration.md for
  details.
- fastspin -O now removes hub bss variables (the VAR block) from the
  .binary; this does not change the actual memory usage at run time,
  but does result in a smaller .binary and hence faster download
- fastspin and spin2cpp no longer have to call themselves to compile
  the .pasm for a --asm binary output
- Better error messages for unexpected characters in the source
- Added strength reduction for multiplication and subtraction
- Convert more loops to use djnz

  constant
- Various other minor optimizations

Version 3.6.6
- Minor tweak to LMM return code
- Use bstc mode in fastspin only if the program name starts with bstc

Version 3.6.5
- Fixed asm output segmentation fault on Debian 64 bit

Version 3.6.4
- Fixed output of const symbols in gas mode
- Fix a hang with --dat --gas output
- In P2 mode, handle hub symbols more like PNut (so usually use byte
  address rather than long address).
- Fixed compilation of getnib, getbyte instructions in P2
- Added check for correct number of operands for instructions found in
  inline assembly
- Added a --require= option to check the version number being used
  
Version 3.6.3
- In --asm --binary mode, delete the final output binary name if
  compilation to assembly fails.
- Fixed a bug in handling C++ methods forced to be static due to
  their use in cognew
- Fixed another optimizer bug (forward propagation of constants was
  crossing call boundaries, which caused problems with things changed
  by the call)
- Fixed immediates on destinations in P2 (like rdfast #0, foo)
- Implemented 3 operand P2 instructions like getbyte, setnib, and
  fixed a few other missing P2 instructions

Version 3.6.2
- fastspin can now compile to binary for P2
- Fixed an optimizer bug where it tried to change INA from a src in
  one instruction to a dest in another (INA as dest points to RAM
  rather than register)
- Fixed preprocessor handling of quoted characters
- Partially updated P2 instructions to v18

Version 3.6.1

  dereferences

  like what a human programmer would add.
- Fixed a problem with assignments inside other operators (evaluation
  was not in the same order as traditional Spin)
  
Version 3.4.1

- Fixed an issue with the not operator on its own (should have
  been turned into an assignment)
  
Version 3.4.0

- Completely revamped --gas output to make it easier to edit and
  to support some constructs (like multiple .org) that could not
  be used in earlier versions of --gas. DAT sections in --gas are
  now quite human readable (and more importantly, modifyable).
- Preserve DAT section comments in --gas output.
- Changed #define for constants so that we can distinguish constants
  in different objects.
  
Version 3.2.3

- Added --side option to create a SimpleIDE .side file.

Version 3.2.2

- Fix coginit/cognew of Spin methods in C mode

- Fixed a bug printing non-ASCII characters
- Fixed several issues preventing the S3 source code from converting
  to C.
- Use C "switch" statements for Spin case where all the labels are
  constant

  not enabled by default because it still has some issues.

Version 3.1.3

- Use "res" for FCACHE space
- Fix bug involving local variables that are arrays
- Improve re-use of variable memory
- Optimize away some redundant branches

Version 3.1.2

- Use "res" instead of "long" to define the object block
- Slightly improve loop optimization by re-arranging optimize passes
- Fix multi-pin assignments to be atomic
- If fastspin.exe is invoked as bstc.exe, it tries to mimic bstc's
  output.

Version 3.1.1

- Make leaf functions share temporary registers and local variables
- Do not inline functions whose calling conventions
  require stack manipulation

Version 3.1.0

- Added (preliminary) --p2 support for Propeller 2.
- Added fcache support for Propeller 1.
- If a function is called only once, and we can eliminate it by
  inlining it, do so.
  
Version 3.0.6

- Added a check to make sure the immediate is on the right operand
  (previously "mov #2, 3" was parsed the same as "mov 2, #3")

Version 3.0.5

- Added --eeprom option to produce an EEPROM file
- Added --cc= option to change C compiler
- Improved optimization of pin masks in some cases
- Allow {++ ... } to insert C++/C code inside PUB or PRI.

Version 3.0.4

- Tweaked a few items in the GUI

Version 3.0.3

- Fixed a problem with the round() function not being recognized in
  C/C++ code, and with round() and trunc() output.
- Fixed abort with no explicit expression in C/C++

Version 3.0.2

- Added support for SPR and for arrays in cog memory generally.
- Allowed --data=cog

Version 3.0.1

- Fixed the distributed .zip file to have the correct spin2cpp
  versions.
- Added a Spin prefix function for --asm output (so other Spin
  compiler may be used)


Version 3.0.0

- Added a code generator to allow for PASM output. spin2cpp --asm can
  function as a compiler independent of PropGCC. With --code=hub it
  will produce LMM code, otherwise it produces COG code. Using
  --binary after --asm will cause a final binary to be produced. Using
  -g after --asm will cause the original Spin code to be inserted in
  the .pasm output.
- Added a simple GUI (spinconvert). See the Help option in spinconvert
  for details
- Added predefined symbols: __SPIN2CPP__ for C/C++ output,
  __SPIN2PASM__ for assembler output
- Added IF/THEN/ELSE expressions, e.g. x := IF x>0 then 0 ELSE x-1
- Extensive internal changes
