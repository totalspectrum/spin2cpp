Version 3.0.5

- Improved optimization of pin masks in some cases
- Allow {++ ... } to insert C++/C code inside PUB or PRI.
- Changed the __SPIN2X__ define to __SPINCVT__. The old __SPIN2X__
  symbol is still defined in the preprocessor for now, but is deprecated.


Version 3.0.4

- Tweaked a few items in the GUI

Version 3.0.3

- Fixed a problem with the round() function not being recognized in
  C/C++ code, and with round() and trunc() output.
- Fixed abort with no explicit expression in C/C++

Version 3.0.2

- Added support for SPR and for arrays in cog memory generally.
- Allowed --data=cog

Version 3.0.1

- Fixed the distributed .zip file to have the correct spin2cpp
  versions.
- Added a Spin prefix function for --asm output (so other Spin
  compiler may be used)


Version 3.0.0

- Added a code generator to allow for PASM output. spin2cpp --asm can
  function as a compiler independent of PropGCC. With --code=hub it
  will produce LMM code, otherwise it produces COG code. Using
  --binary after --asm will cause a final binary to be produced. Using
  -g after --asm will cause the original Spin code to be inserted in
  the .pasm output.
- Added a simple GUI (spinconvert). See the Help option in spinconvert
  for details
- Added predefined symbols: __SPIN2CPP__ for C/C++ output,
  __SPIN2PASM__ for assembler output
- Added IF/THEN/ELSE expressions, e.g. x := IF x>0 then 0 ELSE x-1
- Extensive internal changes

==========================================================================

- Some internal clean-ups

Version 1.95

- Improved detection of static member functions
- Implemented coginit/cognew for Spin methods (still WIP)

  parser likes it, but plain C does not)
- Added commonly used C functions like strcpy to the list of C reserved
  words that we check for name conflicts
- Fixed a preprocessor problem with long file names

Version 1.94

- Declare methods that obviously don't use object variables as "static"
- Supported the bstc @@@ operator (only in --gas mode right now)
- Implemented SPR pseudo-variable for hardware registers
- Cleaned up handling of -o option for .dat, .elf, and .binary
- Fixed some output problems in --gas mode
- Various minor bug fixes

Version 1.93

- Made for loop output more idiomatic
- Print symbolic constants rather than the values they resolve to
- Fixed illegal characters in file names used as class names
- Added some debug directives
- Made -o option more useful with --binary

- Fixed --binary checksum calculation

Version 1.91

- Preserve comments in Spin code.
- Recognize foo.long[N] syntax.
- Use C for loops for more Spin repeat loops.
- Use memset for the common case of filling memory with 0.
- Added clksPet and clkmode.
- Preserve original case of Spin identifiers (unless --normalize is
  given).
- Automatically add volatile qualifier to class variables if some
  class members are accessed via the address operator.
- Added --catalina option to run convert to C then run Catalina C compiler.

Version 1.05

- Fixed a problem with double negation or negation of boolean operators
  being printed as a predecrement.

Version 1.04

- Fix precedence of NOT operator
- Add quoting for spaces inside file names
- Produce an error for redefined labels in DAT sections.
- Rename constants that start with an _ to avoid conflicts with C.
- Fix "reversed" range expressions like OUTA[9..10].

Version 1.03

- Use for() loop instead of do/while for simple counting loops
- Added a -o option to specify the output file name
- Fixed error messages after #include (so correct line number and file
  information is preserved)
- Made the search paths for #include and OBJ sections relative to the
  currently processed file.
- Added --binary output option to produce a .binary file
- Fixed a bug in the DAT section output for classes with names that
  have "Spin" appended.
- Fixed DAT section output in C mode.
- Fixed several other miscellaneous bugs.

Version 1.02

- Made CON section accept x[y] syntax for skipping over ranges of values
- Modified C/C++ output so that unused return values are not declared
- Fixed reboot command to really reboot (not just abort)
- Fixed a typo which could cause segmentation faults
- Follow Spin's practice of allowing the first object of an object
  array to be used without a subscript.
- Accept annotations on the DAT section of a file.

Version 1.01

- Output symbolic names for constants instead of the constant value itself
- Added missing =>= and =<= operators
- Put the spin2cpp version number in the comment header of generated
  files

Version 1.00

- Fixed a problem with parsing negative floating point constants
- Fixed use of $ in PASM data declarations
- Some fixes to the internal source code

Version 0.99

- Added preliminary support for translating PASM to GAS (--gas)
- Added support for waitpne and waitpeq
- Fixed the trunc operator
- Fixed some issues with constants declared in other objects
- Fixed a problem with catching abort of functions with no parameters

Version 0.98

- Cleaned up and improved preprocessor
- Added #include, #elseifdef, #elseifndef
- Further improved Catalina support
- Fixed an issue with returns inside if statements
- Made error messages more consistent (now they all have the format
  "file:line: message", like Catalina and gcc)


Version 0.97

- Added a simple preprocessor similar to the one in bstc
- A comment giving the command line is output at the start of files
- Somewhat improved support for Catalina
- Some minor bugs fixes

Version 0.96 New in this version:

- preliminary support for output of C code instead of C++
- fix the order of defines so constants in one object may be used to
define constants in another object
- support for placing C code inline in the Spin code (via "annotations")
- bug fix for reverse()
- sort variables the way Spin does

Version 0.95. New in this version:

- arrays of objects
