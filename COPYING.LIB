This document describes the copyright of the various library files in
the include directory. For the most part they are either public domain
or under an MIT style license. For exact details see the source code.

Most library functions are by myself or adapted from Parallax sample
code, and MIT licensed. Jeff Roark (user JRoark on the forums)
generously contributed some floating point and math routines which he
has agreed to have distributed under the same terms. Nicolas Benezan's
SpiFlash object is used for low level flash accesses, and is also MIT
licensed, as are Roger Loh's PSRAM and HyperRam/HyperFlash drivers.
