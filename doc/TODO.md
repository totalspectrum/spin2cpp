allow method declarations outside classes

C++ lambdas

Add in the missing openspin options to fastspin.

Add an option to get a report of method sizes and free space left.

Optimization
------------

Put more commonly used functions in COG RAM, and/or FCACHE whole functions

Better fcache loading code.


Long Term
---------

Implement a spin bytecode back end.

Implement a Python-like front end.
